This project will help us to detect WildFire by analysing the satellite captured images. This program also calculates the percentage of wildfire according to the image using the color combination of RGB configuration and check pixels where fire is detected.

The website will ask us to upload a image file, which is then processed to iterate through each and every pixel, hence detecting if the rgb value of the pixel lies between the given range of the color of fire. 

This will also return the percentage of fire on the image uploaded, which tells us about the intensity of the wildfire, hence the public can take the actions accordingly.
