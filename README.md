This project will help us to detect WildFire by analysing the satellite captured images or high-angle captured images. This program calculates the percentage of wildfire occuring probability according to the image using the color combination of RGB configuration and locates pixels where flames are detected.

The website will ask us to upload a image file, which in the function, is then processed to iterate through each and every pixel, hence detecting if the rgb value of the pixel lies between the given range of the color of wildfire colour scheme. This will also return the percentage probability of fire on the image uploaded and a prompt message to the user-end, which tells us about the intensity of the wildfire, hence the public can take the actions accordingly. This system aims to provide timely and accurate information to help in managing wildfires and preventing their spread.
