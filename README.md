this project contains wildfire detection system
Project-name: Wildfire detection system

Group Members:
1) Shivam Patel

this project will help us to detect wildfire by using the images captured by a satellite and using this project, we will get the percentage of wildfire in the image using the color combination of RGB configuration and check pixels where fire is detected and thus we can compute percent of wildfire in the image captured by satellite.

The website will ask us to upload a image file, which is then processed to iterate through each and every pixel, hence detecting if the rgb value of the pixel lies between the given range of the color of fire.
